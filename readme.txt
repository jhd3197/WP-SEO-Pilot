The Open Standard for WordPress SEO. A comprehensive, transparent SEO solution built for developers who believe SEO tooling should be open source.

== Description ==

Saman SEO is a comprehensive, transparent SEO solution built for developers who believe SEO tooling should be open source, not a black box.

For too long, WordPress SEO has been dominated by proprietary solutions that operate as black boxes. Each plugin guards its methods as trade secrets, fragmenting the ecosystem and forcing developers to work around opaque systems.

**Saman SEO takes a different approach**: We believe the SEO industry benefits from transparency, shared standards, and collaborative improvement. By open-sourcing our complete SEO workflow, we're establishing a foundation that the entire WordPress community can build upon, inspect, and enhance.

= Core SEO Management =

* **Per-Post SEO Fields**: Complete meta control with Gutenberg sidebar and classic editor support
* **Server-Rendered Output**: Titles, meta descriptions, canonical URLs, robots directives, Open Graph, Twitter Cards, and JSON-LD structured data
* **Site-Wide Templates**: Centralized defaults for titles, descriptions, social images, robots directives, and hreflang attributes
* **Post-Type Granularity**: Dedicated defaults for each content type

= Advanced Capabilities =

* **AI-Powered Suggestions**: OpenAI integration for intelligent title and meta description generation
* **Internal Linking Engine**: Automated keyword-to-link conversion with rule-based controls
* **Advanced Sitemap Manager**: Full XML sitemap control with post type/taxonomy selection, RSS and Google News sitemaps
* **Audit Dashboard**: Visual severity graphs, issue logging, and automatic fallback generation
* **Redirect Manager**: Database-backed 301 redirects with WP-CLI support and 404 logging
* **Developer Tools**: Snippet previews, social media card previews, internal link suggestions

= Content Analysis =

* **Real-Time Previews**: SERP snippet and social media card simulations
* **Link Opportunity Detection**: AI-powered internal linking suggestions
* **Quick Actions**: Streamlined workflow for common SEO tasks
* **Compatibility Checks**: Automatic detection and graceful coexistence with other SEO plugins

= Privacy & Security =

* **404 Logging**: Opt-in feature that stores only hashed referrers
* **No Telemetry**: Zero external tracking or analytics
* **No External Requests**: All processing happens on your server (except optional AI features)
